# Planning for today

1. Discussions:
    - Sliding window in the regression model:
        - Pros: Greatly improve the performance.
        - Cons?
    - Can an accurate regression model garauntee to detect faults accurately?
        - How to remove the impacts from failure?
        - How to define the decision boundary (threshold)?

2. Discuss the supporting script for regression modeling and fault detection.

3. Working on [WP_3](TD_WP_3_Complete.ipynb):
    - Develop a regression model to predict the normal behaviors.
    - Use the developed regression model to detect failures

# Submission for WP_3
- Submission deadline: midnight, **26/05/2024**.
- How to submit:
    - Prepare a single notebook, named it as "WP3_Group_X.ipynb".
    - In the repository of the administrator:
        - Fetch the most up-to-date change from the original repository (sonic160/digital_twin_robot)
        - Create a new branch called "WP2_submission".
        - Create a new folder called "deliverables" in your workspace. For example, if you are group 1, then, you should have: `projects\maintenance_industry_4_2024\ws_group_1\deliverables`
        - Put your final notebook in this folder.
        - Create a pull request to merge your branch to "main" branch of the original repository (sonic160/digital_twin_robot)
        - Wait for the professor to merge the submission.
